The use of Meta platforms remains infrequent, and this appears to be a reasonable choice. Recently, during a second login attempt on the same day, the system prompted for multiple layers of authentication. After entering the password, email verification was required, followed by SMS verification. Upon attempting to update personal details, the system demanded the password again.

This design reflects a shift toward increasingly complex security protocols, which can be burdensome for users. Despite possessing expertise in computer science, there is significant opposition to these cumbersome processes and the enforcement of mandatory multi-factor authentication (MFA) policies. Such measures should remain optional and implemented only when explicitly requested by users. Platforms like Steam and Riot Games exemplify a more user-centric approach in this regard.

The rationale for enforcing MFA at the login stage, particularly for accounts not linked to financial information, is questionable. For users who primarily operate from secure environments such as homes or offices, a simple password provides adequate protection. While MFA during sensitive actions, such as transactions or personal detail modifications, is more justifiable, mandating it at login appears unnecessary.

Password complexity requirements further exacerbate these challenges. Rules demanding passwords to exceed eight characters and include combinations of uppercase letters, numbers, and special characters impose cognitive burdens on users, especially since such combinations are rarely used in daily life. A more reasonable approach would involve enforcing only a subset of these criteria, such as requiring at least two of the four elements.

In contrast, a noteworthy development in certain regions involves the transition to simplified login methods, such as using a phone number to receive a single SMS for authentication. This approach provides a streamlined experience. However, the preference for "email and an easy password" as a login combination remains strong due to its simplicity and practicality.
